# SDL2 Voxel Game (Minecraft-like)

A simple **3D voxel game written in C++ using SDL2**, inspired by Minecraft.  
The game uses **software rendering only** — **no OpenGL, no Vulkan, no DirectX** — everything is drawn manually via SDL2.

This project is primarily for **learning purposes**, focusing on:
- 3D math
- voxel rendering
- performance optimization
- game engine fundamentals

---

## Features

- 🧱 Voxel-based world (blocks)
- 📐 Custom 3D projection (no GPU acceleration)
- 🎮 First-person camera
- 🧮 Manual perspective calculations
- ⚙️ Written fully in C++
- 🚫 No OpenGL / Vulkan / DirectX

## Building the Project

### Requirements

- C++17 or newer
- SDL2
- SDL2_image (if used)

---

### Windows (MinGW / MSVC)

1. Download SDL2 from the official repo  
   https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases

2. Extract SDL2 and SDL2_image
3. Add inc and lib folders with SDL2 files to the project folder (where main.cpp is)
4. Make sure these DLLs are next to the executable when running:
   - `SDL2.dll`
   - `SDL2_image.dll`

---

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
